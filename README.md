Project Title: Darwinsight
Overview: The purpose of this project is to develop an API endpoint that developers can integrate into their applications to collect and store various data for statistical analysis. The API will be responsible for handling incoming data related to user interactions, such as clicks and search queries. The collected data will be stored in a MongoDB database, and visualizations will be created based on the stored data.

Goals and Objectives
1) Provide a User-Friendly API
2) Capture and store relevant data, including click events and search queries, sent by developers using the API.
3) Implement statistical analysis features to derive insights from the collected data.
Create visualizations (charts, graphs, etc.) to represent the analyzed data.

Tech Stack: React, Node, Express, MongoDB
Additional tools: Geolocation API, Google Charts
